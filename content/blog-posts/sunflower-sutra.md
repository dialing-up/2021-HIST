"The villainous teachings of the Anarchists bore bloody fruit in Chicago tonight, and before daylight at least a dozen stalwart men will have laid down their lives as a tribute to the doctrine of Herr Johann Most” is how the New York Times chose to report the events of the Haymarket affair, with the Chicago Tribune choosing a similar pro-police, anti-protestor tack. This one-sided reporting of an event which has come to be remembered as International Workers’ Day in most of the world, colored the reputation of the event and caused public support for the wrongful death sentence given to eight anarchists.  

‍  
To explain the florid language used, it is necessary to remember that the then most dominant form of journalism was “yellow journalism”, popularized by the media barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, whose newspapers used sensationalist and populist rhetoric. The Tribune and the Times were not owned by either baron, but the language is clearly of the era. There was a general agreement between the newspapers that newspaper circulation was the most important factor, not the factual accuracy of the news reported. This meant that all news reported was in the form of a narrative designed to prey on the feeling of of the reader and sell papers. This ensured that no accurate reporting on the Haymarket affair would have been read by the public at the time.  
‍  
The pro-police and anti-anarchist bias was because of the ownership of the two newspapers, who were businessmen in an era where the concept of ‘editorial independence’ did not particularly exist. The newspapers chose to prey on the anti-socialist and anti-anarchist sentiments, along with anti-immigrant sentiments in their reporting to make a more salacious narrative. The Chicago Tribune took up the cause of the police in their reporting, stirring up anti-anarchist sentiment in the most blatant manner of all the newspapers.  
‍  
The anarchists themselves used their own media sources to broadcast their version of events and their predicament to their readers. While not contemporaneously popular, their version of events has come to be remembered, as an injustice that a biased government and justice system looking for a scapegoat inflicted upon them. But that could not prevent their wrongful convictions and public denunciations, as the anarchist and labor press could not compete with the commercial press in the popularity stakes.  
‍  
To this day, newspaper reporting remains riven with biases like these that promote the current power structure in conscious and unconscious ways. Papers state that “the U.S. labor movement faces unique obstacles to gaining favorable news coverage” and that “Newspaper coverage of police-perpetrated homicides may reflect and promote public and official tolerance for police violence”. These biases are reflected in the attitude of the public.
