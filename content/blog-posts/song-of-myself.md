During the Eighteenth Century in the United States, the economy began with an overwhelming increase in the growth of industrialism. The resources were abundant, an expansion in the labor force, and entrepreneurship allowed mass production for large-scale products and manufactured goods. Yet, for numerous citizens, industrialization was a form of prosperity. On the contrary, the working class, specifically factory workers, did not benefit during the process. During that century, the standard of living for workers had a steady increase; however, by the late 18th hundreds, workers were struggling in order to make ends meet. “\[The\] annual income of at least $600 to live comfortably, but the average worker made between $400 and $500 per year.”( “Worker Conditions In The Factories (Issue)”)

Factory workers of that time overlooked prolonged hours, had poor working conditions, and in their job’s instability. During that time there were a series of recessions and depressions starting from 1836 up until 1891, many workers were laid off, leaving them with a scarcity of new jobs or a cut on their salary payments. New employees, due to changes in positions, found discipline and rules different from the former employment. The workload in Factories was monotonous because they performed the tasks repeatedly. Working hours averaged from at least ten hours per day, six days a week for most workers. (“Working Conditions in The Factories (Issue)”) Men and women with backgrounds in agriculture and in artisanal crafting found Factory working very challenging due to the strict regulation and discipline.

Factory conditions were deplorable and shameful. Due to the lack of government regulation, it leads factory working unsafe and in occasions unhealthy. It was rare for an employer to pay if a worker were ever to get hurt or even to the extremity of being killed for doing their job. “By the 1900 industrial accidents killed thirty-five thousand workers each year...” (“Worker Conditions in The Factories (Issue)”) Workers began to respond to the poor conditions in factories and low wages by intentionally decreasing their production, braking machines, and quitting jobs. Other workers lead by Labor unions joined the protest.

In 1869, one of the most important labor unions was founded by Uriah Smith Stephens. The Knights of Labor or formally known as the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor, was an organization in which intentions were meant to protect members from employer retaliations. Its belief system was of unity with interest groups that compromised of shopkeepers, farmers, and laborers. In 1879, the organization elected Terence V. Powderly. After the railway strike of 1877, Membership in the Knights grew exponentially, with its peak of 700,000 members in 1886. During the peak, “the Knights were the dominant labor organization in the United States.” (“Knights of Labor”)

On August 20th, 1886, the National Labor Union called on congress due to the poor quality of worker conditions and vast labor hours to minimize the hourly work per day to eight hours. Sadly, the National Labor Union failed; however, the Knights of Labor took the flaming torch, discouraging strikes and promoting change in society. However, a series of violent strikes by railroad workers later hurting the reputation of the organization. In May of the same year, a fight was unleashed by the striking workers and strike backers at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Haymarket, Illinois. During the incident, two union men were shot by police, and later an explosion killing seven police officers.
