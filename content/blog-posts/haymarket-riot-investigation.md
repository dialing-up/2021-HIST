This is an event that occurred on May 4, 1886, in which there was a bombing amongst the present police officers and the labor movement. The main point of this movement was for workers to protest for an eight-hour workday however, the police officers tried to break up their protest. Someone threw a bomb and the police officers were injured and one was found dead. No one knew who threw the bomb and everyone was left in the dark. There were eight men who were charged with murder and sent to court for trial where they were found guilty.

These men were not only found guilty but were sentenced to death. These men were not just protesters but they were the leaders of the protester. These men were leaders of the protest which is what gave the court a reason to accuse them of the bombing. They first started the protest which they were not supposed to conduct, to begin with. Additionally, they did not want to stop the officers therefore this could be a reason the court saw to accuse them.

Although the court did not have any proof they still made this a bias decision because they did not have anyone to blame. Not only was the Haymarket riot a one-day event, however, but the decisions also continued to expand over time. The protest began on the 3rd of May,1886. This was because it was the day when two workers were killed by the police officers. This is also another reason the court had to accuse the leaders of the bombing because the workers could use the bombing as revenge for the death of their fellow workers that was caused by the police officers.
