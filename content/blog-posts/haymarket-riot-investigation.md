The Haymarket Riot is an event that occurred on May 04, 1886, in which there was a bombing amongst the present police officers and the labor movement. The main point of this movement was for workers to protest for an eight-hour. However, the police officers tried to break up their protest. According to Galloway (the writer of the Haymarket riot newspaper article), someone threw a bomb, and the police officers were injured, and one was found dead. No one knew who threw the bomb, and everyone was left in the dark. Eight men were charged with murder and sent to court for trial, where they were found guilty.

These men were not only found guilty but were sentenced to death. These men were not just protesters, but they were the leaders of the protester. They were leaders of the protest, which gave the court a reason to accuse them of the bombing. The protest started as a nonviolent strike for workers to have more rights over their working conditions and hours. They started the protest, which they were not supposed to conduct, to begin with. During the Haymarket incident, eight people were killed, and many others were severely injured. The strike for eight-hour workdays turned into a massacre of cop violence versus workers. Additionally, they did not want to stop the officers; therefore, this could be why the court saw to accuse them.

Although the court did not have any proof, they still made this a bias decision because they did not have anyone to blame. Not only was the Haymarket riot a one-day event, however, but the decisions also continued to expand over time. According to the article “Topics in Chronicling America,” the protest began on May 03, 1886. This was because it was the day when two workers were killed by the police officers. This is also another reason the court had to accuse the leaders of the bombing because the workers could use the bombing as revenge for the death of their fellow workers caused by the police officers.

According to Galloway’s article, it is also known that police officers, as well as some protesters, fired back when the bombing occurred. This is a massive hint that one of the protesters did not participate in the bombing because if it was their planning, they would not support the officers in firing back. This is a main hint for the court that the protesters were not a part of the bombing. However, it is continued by the court that all points are reviewed.

Another important thing to keep in mind noted by Galloway is that once the bombing was calmed down, one policeman and four civilians were found dead. This bombing also caused six policemen to be wounded. There were eight leaders in which one was not sentenced to death, but he was sentenced to fifteen years of prison. One of them decided to commit suicide.
